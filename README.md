## Setup

Perform these steps to setup Risk of Rain 2 with the Risky Dudes Modpack.

1. If you don't already have it, buy [**Risk of Rain 2**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/632360/Risk_of_Rain_2/), then launch it and exit.
    - Optionally: Also buy [**Survivors of the Void** DLC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1607890/Risk_of_Rain_2_Survivors_of_the_Void/) for 2 more characters.
2. Install [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/). Follow the directions on that page.
3. Launch `r2modman`.
4. Create a new profile called _"Risky Dudes"_ by pressing the _Create New_ button.
    - If you have any other profiles other than _Default_, you should probably Delete them.
